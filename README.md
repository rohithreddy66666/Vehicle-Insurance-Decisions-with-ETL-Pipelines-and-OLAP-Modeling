# Vehicle-Insurance-Decisions-with-ETL-Pipelines-and-OLAP-Modeling
This project aims to help an insurance company predict whether its health 
insurance customers from the past year will also be interested in vehicle 
insurance provided by the company. The data includes demographics such as 
gender, age, and region code type, as well as information about the customers' 
vehicles and insurance policies. By building a predictive model, the company 
can optimize its communication strategy and increase revenue. To achieve this, 
we will build an OLTP database using a Star Schema Model with fact tables and 
dimension tables, using cloud databases such as Amazon Redshift and 
MySQL. We will extract, transform and load the data using Python scripts and 
orchestrate the ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow. The data will then be 
analyzed using SQL queries and visualized through business intelligence tools 
such as Microsoft Power BI or Tableau. Interesting queries such as the number 
of events in each country, cumulative deaths report, and top 10 analysis in time 
and region based on KPI metrics will be performed. This project showcases 
how cloud-based technologies and machine learning algorithms can be used to 
optimize business strategies and increase revenue.
